In the build.sh file of the Python folder, make sure that SPARK_VERSION matches your local version. Similarly, make sure the pyspark you pip installed also matches this version.\\n\\nSection: General course-related questions\\nQuestion: Course - how many Zoomcamps in a year?\\nAnswer: There are 3 Zoom Camps in a year, as of 2024. However, they are for separate courses:\\nData-Engineering (Jan - Apr)\\nMLOps (May - Aug)\\nMachine Learning (Sep - Jan)\\nThere's only one Data-Engineering Zoomcamp “live” cohort per year, for the certification. Same as for the other Zoomcamps.\\nThey follow pretty much the same schedule for each cohort per zoomcamp. For Data-Engineering it is (generally) from Jan-Apr of the year. If you’re not interested in the Certificate, you can take any zoom camps at any time, at your own pace, out of sync with any “live” cohort.\\n\\nSection: Module 1: Docker and Terraform\\nQuestion: Should I run docker commands from the windows file system or a file system of a Linux distribution in WSL?\\nAnswer: It is recommended by the Docker do\\n[Windows 10 / 11 Home Edition] If you're running a Home Edition, you can still make it work with WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) by following the tutorial here\\nIf even after making sure your WSL2 (or Hyper-V) is set up accordingly, Docker remains stuck, you can try the option to Reset to Factory Defaults or do a fresh install.\\n\\nSection: General course-related questions\\nQuestion: Certificate - Can I follow the course in a self-paced mode and get a certificate?\\nAnswer: No, you can only get a certificate if you finish the course with a “live” cohort. We don't award certificates for the self-paced mode. The reason is you need to peer-review capstone(s) after submitting a project. You can only peer-review projects at the time the course is running.\"\n",

But it\\'s always worth reaching out to the course organizer or instructor to inquire about their policy on late enrollment or joining a course that has already begun.\\n\\nSome possibilities might include:\\n\\n1. Contacting the instructor or course administrator: Reach out to them directly via email or phone and ask if they can accommodate a late enrollment. They may be willing to make an exception, especially if you\\'re willing to catch up on missed material.\\n2. Requesting permission to audit the course: If you\\'re not able to officially enroll in the course, you might consider requesting permission to audit it instead. This would allow you to attend sessions and participate without earning credit or receiving a grade.\\n3. Considering an alternative: If the instructor or course administrator is unable to accommodate your request, you might consider taking a similar course that starts at a later time or exploring alternative options that better fit your schedule.\\n\\nRemember to approach this situation with respect for the other students who have already started the course.
